Project Odin Recipe Project
The project is to build a basic recipe website that will link to several recipes.
While completing this project I will use skills that I have learned with the Project Odin course. This will include various skills such as:
    - Creating folders and files via the terminal
    - Staging and pushing updates to GitHub via the terminal
    - Using VS code to create the html code necessary to make the website function
    - Creating descriptive and useful commit messages when committing changes.
