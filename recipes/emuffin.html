        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pacakage of english muffins</li>
            <li>6 eggs</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped green onions</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>2 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>6 ounces ground breakfast sausage</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Split the muffins open with a fork and 
                toast them in a toaster oven.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl scramble the eggs, green 
                onions and cheddar cheese together. Heat v
                egetable oil in a skillet, pour the egg mixture 
                into the skillet and let it fry in one layer as 
                you would an omelet. When the egg is cooked on 
                the underside, flip the egg over and cook the 
                wet side; remove from heat when cooked through.</li>
            <li>At the same time that the eggs are frying, form 
                the sausage into small patties. Place the sausage 
                in another skillet. Fry until browned, remove from 
                pan and drain on paper towels.</li>
            <li>Make the muffin sandwiches by layering a piece of 
                sausage and a piece of the fried egg between the 
                two muffin pieces. If you intend to freeze the 
                sandwiches, let each part of the sandwich cool before 
                make the sandwiches, then wrap them in plastic wrap 
                and freeze. Reheat in the microwave.</li>
        </ol>
